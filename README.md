# FitBit_DataBaseDesign
Design and development of a database using MySQL

Steps to follow:
•	Select a dataset (Fitbit dataset)
•	understand and load the data into a database.
•	extend it with a use case that will require the addition of tables and queries.

“Deliverable1” would be helpful to understand the use case of our data, the business rules followed to translate the use case to a database, the fully normalized ERD and the data dictionary identifying all tables, primary and foreign keys, attributes, data types.

To know how to upload CSV files to MYSQL database, you can refer "https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-admin-export-import-table.html"

“Deliverable2” refers to the code used to create MQSQL database for our data.

The following queries are used to test our database:

1) Create 3 SQL queries (Test with good and bad data. Show any success messages and errors)

   -->To insert data into a new row into an existing table.

   -->To Update data in an existing row in a table.

   -->To Delete data a row in an existing table. 
    
2) Create 1 function that returns a Value. The function should accept at least 1 parameter.  Test the function (show any success and errors)

3) Create 1 stored procedure that returns an aggregate result (sum, min, max, etc.) given some other Data provided. Test the procedure (show any success and errors)
refer to “Deliverable3” for the output.
